##About me

- A motivated software architect with strong commitment to opensource technologies, particularly PHP and Symfony framework. Check out my [PHP-RAGE4](https://github.com/haphan/php-rage4dns) project on Github

- A full-stack developer that can hack his way from User Interface to Coding business logics and finally setting up production servers. See my [server deployment script](https://gist.github.com/haphan/84eb9755ddd06f09326b) on Gist

- A contributor to Symfony, Doctrine, Drupal and few other OSS projects.

##Fun facts

- I started using Symfony 1 then left to build my own PHP framework because there were too many *magics* in Symfony back then. (Yes! everybody has a personal framework right?). Symfony 2 proves to provide more modular and transparent design which made my come back. Since then I am in a love-hat relationship with Symfony2 (Dependency injection, Form API, YML vs Annotation, etc..).

- A Micro$oft (and IE, and Outlook) hater. Mac for work and Debian for servers please!

- 3 shots of moka espresso everyday or my brain does not work.

- You may often see me following [@fabpot](https://twitter.com/@fabpot), [@eranhammer](https://twitter.com/eranhammer)  [@igorwesome](https://twitter.com/igorwesome), reading [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com), [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com), and laughing out-loud whenever I heard someone complaints [node.js leaks memory](https://www.joyent.com/blog/walmart-node-js-memory-leak).

- Co-founded a digital creative start-up with a friend and failed miserably. What remains important are lessions learnt from that failure though.
