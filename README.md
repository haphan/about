##About me

- A motivated software architect with strong commitment to opensource technologies, particularly PHP and Symfony framework. Check out my [PHP-RAGE4](https://github.com/haphan/php-rage4dns) project on Github

- A full-stack developer that can hack his way from User Interface to Coding business logics and finally setting up production servers. See my [server deployment script](https://gist.github.com/haphan/84eb9755ddd06f09326b) on Gist

- A contributor to Symfony, Doctrine and Drupal projects.

##Fun facts

- I started using Symfony version 1 then left to build my own framework because there were too many *magics in Symfony* back then. (Yes, everybody has a personal framework right?). Since then I am in a hate-and-love relationship with Symfony2 (Dependency injection, Form API, YML vs Annotation, etc..).

- A Micro$oft (and IE, and Outlook) hater. Mac for work and Debian for servers please!

- 3 shots of moka everyday or my brain does not work.

- You may often see me following [@fabpot](https://twitter.com/@fabpot), [@eranhammer](https://twitter.com/eranhammer)  [@igorwesome](https://twitter.com/igorwesome), reading [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com), [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com), and laughing out-loud whenever I heard someone complaints [node.js leaks memory](https://www.joyent.com/blog/walmart-node-js-memory-leak).

- Co-founded a digital creative agency with a friend and failed miserably. I learn many lessions from that failure though.
